## TODO
- Plan how to test when the markets are not running.
    - Like end to end scanning, evaluavation, signals, order executions, tracking and discort alerts.
    
- Evaluate and potentially set up Grafana Loki + Promtail for local log analysis (alternative to Splunk). Include basic config, queries, and alerting hooks.
